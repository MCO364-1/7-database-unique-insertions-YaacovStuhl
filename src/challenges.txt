1) Figuring out the use of wildcards that are executed later was an interesting challenge, although it
didn't end up being so difficult

2)Remembering how to write sql statements was, unfortunately, a challenge. I forgot a lot of it

3)I feel like what I did with a 26 for loop and a char array of the alphabet was a kludge, but I cant think
of any other way to do it. Theres probably an alphabet library or something

4)I still don't really understand some of the code, or how the connecting works
